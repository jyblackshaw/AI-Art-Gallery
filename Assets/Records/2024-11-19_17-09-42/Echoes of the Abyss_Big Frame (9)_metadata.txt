Title: Echoes of the Abyss
Description: The silent world is not so silent. 'Echoes of the Abyss' captures the profound symphony of underwater sound waves, resonating with the heartbeat of the ocean. While human voices remain unheard in this realm, the painting prompts us to question, 'Do we listen enough to the voices of nature? Can we tune in to the rhythm of the universe?'
Prompt: An abstract visual representation of underwater sound waves. The composition should evoke a sense of mystery and awe, with deep blues and purples dominating the color scheme.
