Title: The Dance of the Plague
Description: In 'The Dance of the Plague', death is not just an end, but a grotesque, surreal dance. The garish masks, the frenzied movement, the vibrant colours â€“ they challenge our perceptions of mortality and suffering. Does it disturb you, this macabre dance, or does it prompt you to question our own responses to fear and chaos?
Prompt: A chaotic scene of a medieval town during the plague, with dancers in grotesque masks cavorting in the streets. The image is saturated with vivid, surreal colours, creating an unsettling tension.
