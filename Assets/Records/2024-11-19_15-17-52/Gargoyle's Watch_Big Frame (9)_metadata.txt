Title: Gargoyle's Watch
Description: 'Gargoyle's Watch' invites us into the world of the night-watchers. The gargoyle, under the moon's silvery gaze, is more than a stone beast â€“ it's a guardian, a silent sentinel. Does it fill you with awe, or does it evoke a shiver of unease, a sense of the unknown lurking on the fringes of our understanding?
Prompt: A stone gargoyle perched on a cathedral's edge, overlooking a sleeping city. The moonlight lends a haunting lifelike quality to its grotesque features.
