Title: Oannes: The Babylonian Starmaster
Description: Lift your gaze to the luminescent night sky and cast it back thousands of years ago into the cradle of civilization. The city of Babel bathes in mystical hues of twilight, lit up further by the wisdom descending from the sky. Breathe in the fragrant, dusty air as evening deepens, the hum of knowledge-seeking, bustling Babylonians fills your ears. Oannes, the cosmic apostle, his inscrutable gaze, intense yet compassionate. Can you feel the otherworldly tingle, the electrifying shimmers that his teachings impart? The ambivalence captured here - are we gods to them because we were once aliens? Imagineâ€¦ how must have it been when knowledge of scripts and stars descended directly from the heavens? The painting is an enigma, posing a timeless question - Are we alone, or have we never been?
Prompt: A hyper-realistic oil painting of an ancient Babylonian cityscape at twilight, a river bisects the city bustling with people going about their lives. Emerging from the river is Oannes, half-human, half-fish, an alien being, instructing awed Babylonians in writing and science. There's a radiant nebula visible in the sky, whose colors reflect in the river, suffusing the city in an ethereal glow.
