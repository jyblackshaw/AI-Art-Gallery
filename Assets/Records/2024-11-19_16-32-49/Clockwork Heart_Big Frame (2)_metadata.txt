Title: Clockwork Heart
Description: An intimate ode to human life, 'Clockwork Heart' pulses with the rhythm of a mechanical ballet. The steam's ephemeral dance provokes the question: Are we not, in essence, complex machines driven by the relentless ticking of time? This piece invites you to ponder the fragility of life, the precision of existence, and the delicate balance that keeps the heart – our most vital organ – ticking.
Prompt: An intricate heart-shaped structure made of brass gears, cogs, and pipes, with a steady plume of steam rising from the top against a dark, moody background.
