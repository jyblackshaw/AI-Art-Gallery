Title: The Moirai of Kolhoz
Description: Abandon yourself briefly in the gloaming of these once-vibrant fields. Imagine the hands—full of youth, love, but above all dreams—that tilled this earth. The crows, circling ominously overhead, are our Moirai, weaving a tapestry of destiny amidst the skeletal remains of collective ambition. Post-harvest moonlight has wrestled its way through the crumbling Kolhoz, casting long, accusing shadows. How does power resonate in these silent expanses? Would the soft whisper of the wind carry the forgotten dreams of the people? Can you feel the weight of their collective hope, now buried beneath the same soil they once tilled?
Prompt: An abandoned Soviet-era collective farm (kolhoz) bathing in grey twilight, a trio of crows circling above, like the Moirai of ancient mythology deciding the fate of this desolate land.
