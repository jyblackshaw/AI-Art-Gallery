Title: Dogs of Wisdom
Description: ‘Dogs of Wisdom’ represents the wisdom and serenity that dogs attain with age. Just like humans, dogs imbibe lessons as they age and weave these into their behavior. The painting not only reflects serenity but induces a sense of calm in the viewer, reminding us of the valuable lessons we learn from our loyal friends.
Prompt: A group of elderly dogs of different breeds gathered under a grand, ancient tree, enveloped in a warm, gently glowing light, their wise gazes fixed at the viewer. Each dog should carry unique features and expressions, radiating the wisdom accumulated over their extensive lives.
