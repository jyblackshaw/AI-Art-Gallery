Title: Wrecked Relics
Description: A forgotten vessel, once a mariner's pride, now lies in silent repose on the ocean floor. Its skeletal remains, woven with coral tapestry, tell tales of voyages from a time long past. Does the cycle of decay and rebirth not remind us of the transient nature of our existence? In the grandeur of nature, how significant are our individual stories?
Prompt: A detailed, haunting depiction of an ancient shipwreck on the ocean floor, overgrown with coral and marine life. The mood is somber yet tranquil.
