Title: The Silent Symphony
Description: Once, 'The Silent Symphony' echoed with the harmonies of a thousand voices. Now, it sings a different tune - a melody of silence and abandonment. When does art cease to exist? When the audience leaves or when the music stops?
Prompt: An abandoned concert hall with grand arches and ornate decorations covered in a layer of dust. The air is heavy with the memory of music.
