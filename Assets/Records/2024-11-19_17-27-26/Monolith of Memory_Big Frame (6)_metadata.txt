Title: Monolith of Memory
Description: 'Monolith of Memory' stands as a testament to collective remembrance. It asks us, how do we honor those who've gone before us? In stone and steel or in memory and meaning?
Prompt: A massive war memorial, etched with names and dates. Flowers and candles, long since wilted and extinguished, suggest a site of remembrance.
